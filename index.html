        <h3>The Beginning - <i>Scrubs</i></h3>
        <p>Amber and Adam met while working together as Resident Advisors at Algonquin College. They were assigned to work together in MacDonald House (AKA the Best House) and frequently worked together as duty partners.</p>
        <p>After a few months of working together the two realized they are both rather wacky and silly and got along really well. They had discussed similar Netflix interests and were both interested in watching the show <i>Scrubs</i>. One night, Adam invited Amber up to his room to watch <i>Scrubs</i> together and the rest is history.</p>
